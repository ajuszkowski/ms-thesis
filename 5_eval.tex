\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:eval}

\section{Example of the work}
Take one of the tests. Draw a CF-graph, unrolled, CF+DF-graph.

What outputs.


\subsection{Performance}

Measure time by \porthos[1], \porthos[2]:

- enc-time absolute values

- rate enc-time/solve-time


Compare sizes of formulas


memory usage -- for both encoding and solving




\section{Comparison with HERD}

\subsection{Unique Features}

- (inherited from the first version) : two memory models, smt, ... (?)

- (new) -- ?

- kernel?? TODO: SUPPORT some kernel funcs.


\subsection{Performance}

- perhaps, better performance on a large test
